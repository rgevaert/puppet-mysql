* The following variables have been removed from params.pp.  They
  were changed into class variables:
    notify_services
    multi_password
    multi_initscript (was initscript)
    multi_create_instance_script (was create_instance_script)

  Check if the defaults are still sane for your environment.

* Fix some dynamic lookup variables.
